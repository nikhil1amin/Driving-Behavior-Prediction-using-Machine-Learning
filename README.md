# Driving Behavior Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains the Code and Documentation for a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to predict driving behavior using data obtained from the IOT sensors attached to the vehicles.

## Introduction
Road accidents are a major public health concern worldwide, and driving behavior is a significant contributor to these accidents. Traditional approaches to addressing this problem have focused on improving road infrastructure and implementing traffic regulations. However, recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science provide new opportunities for predicting and mitigating driving behavior. In this project, we present a case study on the development of an ML algorithm to predict driving behavior using data from vehicles.
